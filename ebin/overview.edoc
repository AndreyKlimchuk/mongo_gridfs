== Introduction ==

mongo_gridfs is an OTP application library for accessing files stored in MongoDB using the GridFS convention. The
mongo_gridfs API is similar to the official <a href="http://api.mongodb.org/erlang/mongodb/">MongoDB driver</a> but 
create, read and delete operations operate on files rather than documents.
